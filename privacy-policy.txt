Privacy Policy for SoniEffect
December 31, 2025

At SavifyPro, your privacy and security are our top priorities. Our apps are designed to process everything locally on your device, with no personal data collection, no tracking, and no sharing.

This Privacy Policy explains in detail how the app works, the permissions it requests, and how your information is fully protected.

By using our apps, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.

1. Absolutely No Data Collection
We collect nothing. Absolutely nothing.
All music playback, playlists, and artwork are handled entirely on your device.
No personal data, audio files, or identifiers are uploaded, transmitted, or logged.

2. Permissions and Their Safe Use
Even though the app requests certain Android permissions, none are used to collect personal data. They are required only to enable local functionality:

- INTERNET
  Used only for optional online features, such as fetching album artwork, metadata, or checking for updates.
  When checking updates, the app sends only the current app version, nothing else.

- ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
  Checks if your device is online for optional online features, such as updates or album artwork.

- WAKE_LOCK
  Keeps music playback running even when your screen is off.

- VIBRATE
  Provides optional haptic feedback when interacting with the app.

- FOREGROUND_SERVICE & FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK
  Allows uninterrupted music playback in the background.

- READ_MEDIA_AUDIO
  Required to access and play audio files stored locally.
  Audio files never leave your device.

- POST_NOTIFICATIONS (Optional)
  Used to show notifications about playback or app updates.
  Notifications can be disabled at any time.

3. Update Checking
When the app launches, it may check for updates by sending the current app version to our server.
The server responds only with update information if a newer version is available.
No other data (such as device identifiers, personal info, or music files) is transmitted.
This feature exists purely to alert users about updates and improve user experience.

4. Local Processing
All music playback, playlist management, and metadata handling are processed entirely on your device.
No data is uploaded, analyzed, or shared.
The app works fully offline if desired.

5. Local Storage
Temporary caches may be stored for artwork or metadata to improve performance.
All caches are local only and deleted when the app is uninstalled.

6. Notifications
Notifications are used only to show playback or update information.
They do not contain personal information and cannot be used for tracking.
Users may disable notifications in device settings at any time.

7. Children’s Privacy
Our apps are not designed for children under 13.
Since no personal data is collected, there is no risk to children.

8. Security
All music files remain on the device.
Temporary caches are minimal and do not contain personal identifiers.
No personal data can be exposed because the app does not collect any.

9. User Control
Users can grant or revoke permissions at any time.
Music playback, playlists, and caches remain local.
Uninstalling the app deletes all cached data.

10. Third-Party Libraries
We use only open-source libraries for UI, caching, or background playback.
No third-party library collects personal data.
All processing remains local by design.

11. Updates to This Policy
Privacy practices may change with app improvements.
Since no personal data is collected, updates are mostly clarifications or compliance improvements.
The latest version is always accessible in-app or on https://savifypro.com.
